## ðŸŽ¤SPEECH-TO-TEXT-API-GENERATOR
The Speech to Text service uses google's speech regognition abilities to convert speech into text.The transcription of incoming audio is sent back to the client with minimal delay. The service is accessed via Heroku interface; a REST HTTP interface is also available.

## API GENERATE
# https://voice-recog-app.herokuapp.com/api
API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time we use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on our phone, weâ€™re using an API.
We used INSOMNIA to create,design the API based on index.js,express and used the free hosting abilities of Heroku to generate our API.

# INPUT 
Audio in the form of base64 encoded jason file
# Output

## SPEECH RECOGNITION
For this purpose we used the python libraries like speech recognition,librosa,json,base64,soundfile etc.This here take your voice in base64 encoding or live audio and converts it into normal string.

## USER INTERFACE
It's a basic UI made from html,css and java script

## Corner and edge Cases that are to be avoided-
1. Directly accessing the API link, which in turn inputs no data in the API. This breaks it and is to be avoided right now.
2. Trying to process files that do not contain their bitrate causes the API to crash.
